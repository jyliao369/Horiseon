# Horiseon Refactoring-HW

## Overview/Description

This project is to teach software developers how to refactor an existing code. Refactoring is very important in software developing. Think of it as like debugging a code. Basically, it is taking a established code and making any changes to it that could make it work better than the previous version. This could mean adding additional lines of code or even taking out lines of code as long as the application or web works in the same way or better than the original. Below are a couple of key topics and terms that developers will learn through the process of this activity.

## Goal

The goal of this project/acivity is to teach the general basics of HTML and CSS in terms of what each of the files do in web application. In addition, developers will get a taste of the potential of HTML and CSS as they continue to learn new aspects of HTML and CSS and potentially add a third factor call JAVASCRIPT. 

## Key Topics

* HTML
  * Semantics
  * Classes
  * IDs
  * Proper Structure
  * Nested Elements
* CSS
  * Basic function of CSS
  * Selectors
  * Attributes 
  * Backgrounds and Borders
  * Text and Typography
  * Values and Units
* Miscellaneous 
  * Graphics
  * Images
  * Links and Hyperlinks
  * Image Alts
  * Titles

For this activity, an established code is given and the objective of this activity is to make any changes to code. These changes can be deleting or consolidating files in both the HTML and the CSS file. The main objective is to understand the different elements and classes that make up a HTML and CSS file. In addition, developers should also learn the proper structures used to make HTML and CSS file as well as he proper semantics used in creating a application or website. Additional learning objectives are listed below. By the end of this homework activity, developers will be employer-competitive and competent to make your own website.

## Learning Objectives

* Build and style a static webpage with proper semantic in both HTML and CSS file
* Implement best practices and standards when structuring HTML files using proper elements, indentation, comments, etc.
* Implement CSS styling via class, id and element selectors using external stylesheets
* Other objectives include performing common commands via the command line to interface with the operating system, such as navigating the file tree and creating and deleting files and directories
* Execute live deployment using GitHub Pages
